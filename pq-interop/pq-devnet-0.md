### Testing:

>testing ideas below is AI slop

#### PQ Signature Viability
  * Key generation and signing/verification timings - kurtosis - generate keys for 1,000 validators and measure sub-second targets.
  * Adversarial testing: Inject bad signatures via custom actors; verify rejection.
  * EIP-7870 compliance: Monitor CPU/memory/bandwidth during runs.

#### Multi-Client Interop
  * Sync testing: Start nodes at different points; use block-by-root to catch up.
  * Attestation correctness: Assertoor-like test for â‰¥98% (Zeam) or local tally (Ream).
  * Fork choice: Test with mini 3SF or no consensus; verify chain views align.
  * Networking: Gossip propagation delays <1s; QUIC/TCP comparison.

#### Resource Requirements
  * Run with 1,000 validators; scale to 10,000; measure EIP-7870 limits.
  * Hardware metrics: CPU load, memory, throughput every second.
  * Bonus: Inject adversaries (signature collisions, censoring); monitor resilience.

#### Success Criteria Validation
  * Network runs for 300+ slots * num_clients without crashing.
  * Full block pipeline <6s (Ream) or on-time with 4s slots (Zeam).
  * `num_attestations_received / num_validators  >= 0.098` for every slot (i.e. 98% attestation arrival)
  * `num_valid_signatures == num_attestations_received` for every slot (i.e. 100% attestation correctness)
