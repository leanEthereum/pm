# PQ Devnet-0 Specs


### Devnet Change Log
- No changes, initial devnet 


### Active Discussions

- **Sig Parameters:**
    - Hash chains: 64
    - Chain length: 8
    - Max lifetime: 2^32
    - Activation time: 2^18
- **Slot Duration:** 4 seconds
- **Networking Transport:** QUIC
- **Gossip:** Gossipsub v1.2
- **Validator Count:** Start with 512 keys (meeting consensus) and scale up to 1024 validators
- **Consensus Mechanism:** Minimal fork choice rule (to be spec'ed)
- **Infrastructure Setup:** Should we engage ethPandaOps to:
    - Set up and host a shared Grafana and Prometheus instance for this effort?
    - Fork Kurtosis to support leanEthereum devnets (and patch in Genesis Generator)?
    - Use ethPandaOps Docker image builder and tracker to build/publish CL images?

### Testing:

>testing ideas below is AI slop

#### PQ Signature Viability
  * Key generation and signing/verification timings - kurtosis - generate keys for 1,000 validators and measure sub-second targets.
  * Adversarial testing: Inject bad signatures via custom actors; verify rejection.
  * EIP-7870 compliance: Monitor CPU/memory/bandwidth during runs.

#### Multi-Client Interop
  * Block-by-root: Use for recovery to catch-up to chain head when nodes break; include chianing to pull parent chains for latest gossip blocks.
  * Attestation correctness: Assertoor-like test for â‰¥98% (Zeam) or local tally (Ream).

#### Resource Requirements
  * Run with 1,000 validators (devnet-0); scale by 10x validators for each iteration to 10,000; measure EIP-7870 limits.
  * Hardware metrics: CPU load, memory, throughput every second.
  * Bonus: Inject adversaries (signature collisions, censoring); monitor resilience.

#### Success Criteria Validation
  * Network runs for at least 300 slots * num_clients without crashing for local testing; for cluster devnet, aim for longer durations (e.g., 10 days), subject to test infrastructure capabilities (Extended runs will be beneficial for incorporating features like 3SF in subsequent devnet iterations).
  * Full block pipeline <6s (Ream) or on-time with 4s slots (Zeam).
  * `num_attestations_received / num_validators  >= 0.098` for every slot (i.e. 98% attestation arrival)
  * `num_valid_signatures == num_attestations_received` for every slot (i.e. 100% attestation correctness)
