# PQ Interop

## Overview
PeerDAS (Peer Data Availability Sampling) is a networking protocol that allows beacon nodes to perform data availability sampling (DAS) to ensure that blob data has been made available while downloading only a subset of the data. PeerDAS utilizes gossip for distribution, discovery for finding peers of particular data custody, and peer requests for sampling.
