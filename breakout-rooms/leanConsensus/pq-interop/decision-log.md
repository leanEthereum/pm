# PQ Interop Decision Log

Records when features are deferred or moved between DevNets.

## Deferrals & Moves

| Date | Item | From | To | Reason |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | -- | ------ |
| 2026-01-14 | Dynamic validator set | DevNet 3 | DevNet 4 | Adds complexity while devnets aren't stable; defer until checkpoint sync improves stability |
| 2026-01-14 | Multiple aggregation subnets | DevNet 3 | DevNet 4 | Derisk complexity; focus on single subnet first |
