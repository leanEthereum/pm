## Summary
Eylon Yogev provided a high-level overview of correlated agreement and mutual correlated agreement in Reed-Solomon codes, emphasizing proximity gaps and conjectures up to the Johnson bound. He explained RS codes with parameters (n, d, ρ), where functions close to low-degree polynomials share agreement regions. Correlated agreement implies that a random linear combination close to a codeword means individual functions agree on the same subset. Mutual correlated agreement extends this, ensuring the combination itself has correlated agreement, preserving list decoding. Discussions clarified notations (e.g., sets S as ordered for restrictions), probabilistic vs. counting views, and implications for unique vs. list decoding radii. Proofs for unique decoding and conjectures for list decoding were highlighted, with applications to WHIR and query complexity for low-degree testing. Attendees debated distance relaxations, epsilon bounds, and equivalences between correlated and mutual forms.

## Key Takeaways
- Correlated agreement: Random linear combinations close to codewords imply individual functions agree on correlated subsets; proven up to Johnson bound.
- Mutual correlated agreement: Extends to the combination itself, preserving list decoding; conjectured equivalent to correlated agreement in error bounds.
- Unique decoding: Mutual agreement follows from standard theorems; list decoding requires conjectures, with exact errors post-Johnson bound.
- Query complexity: For rate 1/2, unique decoding needs ~300 queries for 128-bit security; capacity bound reduces to 128, enabling fewer queries with grinding.
- Open: Relaxing distances for better epsilons; rewriting as implications or counting arguments; equivalences between forms for general codes.
