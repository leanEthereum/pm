## Summary
Justin Drake opened the PQ Workshop with an overview of Ethereum's post-quantum (PQ) security roadmap, emphasizing the long-term vision for lean consensus and aggregation. He highlighted the event's success by noting that rooms are prebooked for 2026, underscoring ongoing commitment. Drawing from historical context, including a 2018 post on BLS aggregation and Vitalik Buterin's 2019 vision of "STARKs, STARKs, and lots of STARKs," Drake outlined key theses shaping PQ development: mandatory aggregation for efficiency, recursive SNARKs for collaborative and flexible processing, hash-based cryptography for security and simplicity, and formal verification to ensure bug-free implementation.

The PQ stack was detailed as a modular system: leaf signatures using Poseidon2 (SNARK-friendly hash), zkWinternitz (one-time signatures), and zkXMSS (many-time signatures); aggregation via WHIR (small proofs), SuperSpartan (PIOP), and a custom LeanISA for XMSS verification with recursive capabilities. The goal is a lean multi-signature scheme specifiable in under 1,000 lines of Python, with performance targets of 1,000 XMSS signatures per second on a laptop CPU. Recent optimizations have achieved a 6x improvement, with further gains expected.

Drake stressed nurturing public goods like WHIR, Poseidon2, LeanSig, and ArkLib, and divided attendees into focus groups (PQ devnet, theory, implementation, formal verification) with coordinators. Open problems include devnet demos, aggregation topology, zkWinternitz encodings, LeanVM recursion, WHIR integration with Plonky3, and a credible formal verification plan. The agenda features short talks, daily debriefs, and social events like punting to dinner and a closing speech on quantum error correction.

## Key Takeaways
- Aggregation is essential for handling high signature volumes (e.g., scaling to 16,000 signatures/second) and preventing 10x performance degradation across blockchains.
- Hash-based signatures prioritize minimal assumptions, enabling elegant, secure designs provable in the standard model.
- Formal verification, backed by a $20M program and AI assistance, aims for end-to-end coverage, bootstrapping from modular components.
- Performance optimizations target CPU-only aggregation, with potential GPU boosts, positioning LeanSig as a potential industry standard.
- Workshop fosters collaboration on public goods and open problems, with a timeline aiming for launch in late 2028/early 2029 after rigorous testing.
