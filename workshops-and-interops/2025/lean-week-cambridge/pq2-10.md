## Summary
The session focused on PQ Devnet aggregation and networking strategies for 16k validators/nodes, modeling 32 global aggregators, 64 subnets, and ~256 local aggregators per subnet. Discussions covered parameters (16k validators, 256 subnet size, 10 SNARKs/second), aggregation reuse, UDP chunking for 512KB aggregates (MTU 1280 bytes for IPv6/UDP, ~432 chunks/slot), authentication (BLS/ephemeral keys vs XMSS, subnet IDs), anonymity (mixnets, oblivious routing), and reuse across aggregators (commitments/hashes for matching). Erasure coding via adapted KZG library (no proofs, just encoding/decoding) for ~38 chunks/2KB, with IPv4/IPv6 considerations. Explored dynamic aggregators, feedback loops for inclusion scoring, and trade-offs (latency vs efficiency, direct vs pubsub).

## Key Takeaways
- Model 16k nodes, 32 global aggregators, 64 subnets; aim for 256 local aggregators/subnet, dynamic assignment.
- UDP chunking for aggregates: MTU 1280 bytes yields ~432 chunks/slot; include slot/chunk IDs, signatures for authentication.
- Reuse aggregates via commitments/hashes; high overlap in global (low PQ need), low in local (omit PQ).
- Anonymity via mixnets/obvious HTTP; pubsub for resilience, direct for efficiency; map keys without de-anonymization.
- Adapt KZG lib for erasure coding (no KZG proofs); IPv6 MTU limits packing; benchmark alternatives.
