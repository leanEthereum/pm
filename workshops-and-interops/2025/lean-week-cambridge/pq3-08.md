## Summary
Justin Drake facilitated the Day 3 recap, featuring a live Devnet-0 demo by Julian Sutherland (Nethermind) showcasing multi-client interop (Ream/Rust, Zeam/Zig, Qlean/C++) achieving finality with 3SF-mini on a local setup via Docker Compose, including a LeanView explorer dashboard. Raúl Kripalani outlined P2P aggregation modeling (16k nodes, 32 global/256 local aggregators, 64 subnets, UDP chunking for 512KB aggregates over IPv6 MTU), emphasizing streaming pipelines and protocol optimizations. Keygen discussions highlighted caching middle tree layers for gigabyte-scale secret keys, reducing recomputation to ~1s every 3 days. Formal verification recapped zkVM designs (Cairo M continuations, IO gadgets) and agent-assisted proofs. Implementation covered FFT optimizations (base-field, ring-switching, cache-oblivious), Poseidon updates, and generic APIs. Theory sessions reviewed encodings (uniform sampling, rejection handling, security proofs) and Proximity Prize progress (numerical experiments, combinatorial bounds on eta). Closing remarks noted collaborations, future workshops (e.g., Newton Institute), and a special dinner.

## Key Takeaways
- **Devnet Demo**: Successful interop with 3 clients (Ream, Zeam, Qlean) on 3SF-mini; LeanView explorer for monitoring; foundation for Devnet-1 (PQ sigs) and Devnet-2 (aggregation/recursion).
- **P2P Aggregation**: Modeled scalable topology; UDP chunking (~432 chunks/aggregate); commitments for reuse; anonymity via mixnets; prototype specs forthcoming.
- **KeyGen Optimization**: Cache middle layer to reduce storage (~MBs) and recompute (~1s/3 days); aligns with VSF/2SF upgrades requiring signature changes.
- **Formal Verification**: Explored zkVM architectures (continuations, inter-table checks); ArkLib for verified proofs; discussions on compilers/languages.
- **Implementation**: zkVM opcodes/memory models; FFT benchmarks showing gaps in larger instances; Plenta ~20% faster; Poseidon constants coordination with Plonky3.
- **Theory**: Poseidon history/security (bounties/grants/workshops); encodings uniformity/rejections (circuit control flow, quantum proofs); Proximity Prize numerics/combinatorics (eta bounds, counterexamples).
- **Meta**: Cross-team synergies (e.g., encodings feedback); outreach to mathematicians (e.g., Timothy Gowers); future events for deeper analysis.
