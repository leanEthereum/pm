## Summary
The Day 2 kickoff, moderated likely by Justin Drake, outlined the agenda focusing on four tracks: devnet, formal verification, implementation, and theory, with alternating sessions. Team leads shared goals: Unnawut "O" Leepaisalsuwanna (devnet) discussed bindings for research libraries (C++, Rust, Zig), metrics for performance and networking, and a breakout for zero-knowledge drop among clients like Reth, Zeam, and Lantern, aiming for interop by day's end. Alexander Hicks (formal verification) highlighted sessions on encodings with Benedikt, n12 verification expansion, and ArkLib walkthrough, noting its role in mathematical foundations with 6-8 core contributors and a call for more. Thomas Coratger (implementation) emphasized bindings integration, leanVM architecture discussions, and memory arguments, leveraging expertise for optimizations. Benedikt Wagner (theory) covered the ethSTARK toy problem with Albert Garreta's new results (conjecture potentially false) and mutual correlated agreement presentations by Eylon Yogev and Ulrich HabÃ¶ck, continuing Proximity Prize talks technically. No organized dinner; lounge available for informal work. Session ended with a 7-minute break.

## Key Takeaways
- Devnet focus on bindings, metrics, and client interop to achieve zero-knowledge drop, setting up for PQ features tomorrow.
- Formal verification sessions aim to expand tools like ArkLib, seeking feedback and new contributors for collaborative growth.
- Implementation track targets client-primitive linkages, leanVM architecture debates, and memory optimizations for efficiency.
- Theory sessions explore conjectures in ethSTARK toy problem (potentially disproven) and mutual correlated agreement, advancing PQ security analysis.
- Emphasis on flexibility in agenda, social collaboration, and access to lounge for ongoing discussions.
