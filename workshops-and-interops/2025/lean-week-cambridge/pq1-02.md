## Summary
Antonio Sanso presented a survey of algebraic attacks on the Poseidon and Poseidon2 hash functions, highlighting seven years of cryptanalysis efforts critical to Ethereum's post-quantum security. He began with an overview of the Poseidon Initiative (2024-2026), led by the Ethereum Foundation's Poseidon Group (George Kadianakis, Dmitry Khovratovich, Antonio Sanso) and an advisory board including Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Eli Ben-Sasson, DE Hopwood, Daniel Lubarov, and Ron Rothblum. The initiative, with a $600K budget for 2025, includes bounties, research grants, workshops (three held in 2025, fourth upcoming), special awards, and Groebner basis explorations, aiming to conclude by January 2027.

Sanso recapped Poseidon (2019) as a SNARK-friendly hash using field operations and S-boxes (degree 3 or 5), and Poseidon2's refined structure with full (heavy) and partial (light) rounds for better performance. He categorized attacks as brute-force, statistical, and algebraic (interpolation for univariate/bivariate polynomials, Groebner basis for multivariate systems), focusing on the CICO (Constrained Input Constrained Output) problem for preimage attacks.

Key advances include 2022 univariate attacks using Rabin/Cantor-Zassenhaus (breaking some 2021 bounties) and 2025 Graeffe transform-based attacks over finite FFT-fields (p = Ïƒ2^k + 1), which broke three Poseidon-64 bounties faster than prior methods. For bivariate systems, 2025 resultant-based attacks using Sylvester matrices solved CICO-2, breaking Poseidon-31 bounties. Groebner basis remains the go-to for higher k (>2) multivariate systems.

The talk emphasized Poseidon's role in Ethereum's PQ stack and the initiative's success in accelerating cryptanalysis, with open problems like extending interpolation attacks, applying Graeffe to bivariates, and optimizing Groebner for k=3/4.

## Key Takeaways
- The Poseidon Initiative has driven significant cryptanalysis, breaking multiple bounties and enhancing confidence in Poseidon's security through targeted funding and collaborations.
- Graeffe transform exploits special primes (e.g., Goldilocks, BLS12-381 scalar field), achieving 3x faster univariate solving, demonstrating the value of prime-specific optimizations.
- Bivariate attacks via resultants efficiently broke reduced-round Poseidon instances, highlighting vulnerabilities in constrained scenarios.
- Groebner basis is currently optimal for complex multivariate CICO problems, but improvements could further test Poseidon2's robustness.
- Ongoing open problems focus on extending attacks to more rounds, with implications for refining parameters in Ethereum's lean consensus and PQ signatures.
