## Summary
Assimakis Kattis (independent resesercher) presented generic VM compilation architectures for optimal VMs, emphasizing co-design of ISAs with tree-based execution/memory traces for efficient local verifications. He outlined principles: efficiency (few constraints, recursion), auditability (simple/modular code, reusable libs, generic proofs), usefulness (expressive ISA). Demonstrated Fibonacci example with traversable ISAs as proper n-ary trees; local transitions verify ops/memory. Costs: 3-4 degree-4 gates per op, ~k columns for extension k. Q&A explored tree structures (proper n-ary, no-ops for fixed fan-out), jumps (local checks), memory (separate tree, lookups emulate), stack (implicit via indices/accumulators, depth limited by rows).

## Key Takeaways
- Tree-based traces enable fully local transitions; outputs verifiable with 3-4 gates.
- Traversability requires fixed fan-out per op; no-ops pad for structure.
- Execution/memory independent; IO gadget handles lookups, accumulators track requests/responses.
- ~2 gates for stack (line/counter updates); accumulator uses randomness for unique indices.
- Implies cheap proofs; RISC-V analysis applicable.
