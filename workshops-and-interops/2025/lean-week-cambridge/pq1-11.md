## Summary
In a workshop led by Giacomo Fenzi and Benedikt Wagner, participants discussed rules for the $1M Proximity Prize to resolve proximity gaps, list-decoding, and coding-theory conjectures critical for proof systems like WHIR. Key debates included awardable results (proofs/counterexamples/reductions with practical impact), handling constants (larger ones qualify if useful, scaled payouts), validation (community acceptance over peer review; no formal verification required for payout), AI/spam policies (allow AI, self-assessment/novelty checks, rate limits, no anonymity ban but prioritize track records), pseudonymity (permit with history), outreach (target coding theorists/mathematicians via journals/conferences/roadshows/grants), and partitioning ($1M split by conjecture relevance). No final rules set, but consensus on precise statements, tiered bounties, impact rubrics, and public trackers. Next steps: Draft prize description, define tiers/reference protocols, plan submission portal/postmortems.

## Key Takeaways
- **Awardable Results**: Proofs/counterexamples/reductions/partial results; prioritize practical impact on security/performance; tiered payouts (e.g., full for breakthroughs, medium for relaxations/attacks).
- **Constants/Parameters**: Larger constants OK if useful; focus on techniques over optimization; separate bounties for constants post-proof.
- **Validation**: Community acceptance (e.g., Millennium norms); peer review supportive; formal verification encouraged but separate (additional bounty); time-box payouts vs. wait for stability.
- **AI/Spam Policies**: Allow AI; require self-assessment; rate limits (e.g., 1/month/identity); discourage throwaways; publish "known bad approaches" to deter.
- **Pseudonymity/Anonymity**: Permit pseudonymous with track record; no ban on anonymous but deprioritize; focus on quality/correctness.
- **Outreach**: Engage academics via grants/student funding/visibility; advertise in ACM/IEEE/AMS/ECCC; workshops/hackathons/roadshows to bridge proof systems/coding theory.
- **Partitioning/Impact**: Split $1M across conjectures (proximity/list-decoding/agreement) by relevance; reference protocols/rubric for theoretical-to-practical mapping.
- **Process**: Timestamped portal; "CFAIL" archive for failed attempts; negative results incentivized; empirical counterexamples qualify if lowering security.
