## Summary
Giacomo Fenzi provided an overview of hash-based zkSNARKs, emphasizing their evolution and dominance in modern systems due to advantages like transparent setups (relying solely on hash functions), efficient implementations without public-key crypto, tight security in the random oracle model (ROM), and plausible post-quantum security in the quantum ROM (QROM). He traced their history from elliptic curve schemes (e.g., ECDSA, KZG) through IOP-based systems like FRI and Aurora, noting the 2019 "Cambrian explosion" of SNARKs (e.g., STARK, Plonk, Spartan) and zkVMs, many hash-based, with adoption in blockchains (Zcash, Polygon) and applications like Google Wallet.

Fenzi explained constructions via Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOPs) compiled with cryptographic commitments (e.g., BCS16 transformation using Merkle trees and Fiat-Shamir), yielding proofs of 50-120 KiB, prover times of 1-10s on consumer hardware, and verification in 100Î¼s-2ms. IOP efficiency stems from frontend (witness encoding with error-correcting codes like Reed-Solomon for optimal rate-distance trade-offs and FFT encoding) and backend (proximity tests).

He delved into correlated agreement: basic (individual codewords close to the code), correlated (agreement on the same "stripe"), and mutual (final linear combination agrees on the same stripe as initials, preventing new correlated domains). This underpins IOP security, reducing proof size and verification time.

The Proximity Prize ($1M) aims to formalize and prove mutual correlated agreement conjectures for zkSNARK enhancements, with workshop focus on bikeshedding (prize conditions, formal verification), theory (conjecture formulations, literature surveys), and improvements (e.g., factor-of-7 bound enhancements for protocol optimization), potentially yielding 2x recursion speed gains.

Finally, Fenzi discussed optimizing WHIR (a hash-based proof system) for Ethereum's PQ stack, focusing on sigma IOPs for better recursion, batching, and experimental conjecture validation with small parameters.

## Key Takeaways
- Hash-based zkSNARKs offer superior efficiency (e.g., committing to 2^26 elements in ~800ms vs. ~3m for group-based) and security, making them ideal for Ethereum's PQ aggregation.
- Reed-Solomon codes are pivotal for optimal IOPs, enabling efficient encoding and proximity tests critical to proof systems.
- Mutual correlated agreement strengthens IOP security; proving related conjectures via the Proximity Prize could double recursion speed and de-risk hash-based protocols.
- WHIR optimizations, including sigma IOPs, target faster proof generation/verification, with open questions on experimental validation to guide theoretical proofs.
- Workshop goals: Formalize conjectures, survey literature, and advance bounds for practical Ethereum PQ integration.
