## Summary
Alexander Hicks from the Ethereum Foundation's snarkification team outlined the zkEVM Formal Verification Project, emphasizing robust tooling and methodologies for ongoing development beyond one-off verifications. He highlighted benefits like accelerated engineering, reduced manual audits, and automated bug detection through formal methods integrated into workflows. Current efforts span three tracks: zkVM (ensuring constraints/witnesses produce valid proofs only for correct computations, with RISC-V circuits verified against specs using Lean/SMT solvers/LCIR), EVM (verifying lowered bytecode executes per formal EVM spec across Rust targets), and cryptography (verifying proof systems against executable specs backed by formalized security proofs). Workshop sessions focus on ArkLib (spec validation and Rust verification via HACL*), end-to-end coverage (LeanVM, consensus, compilers), and PQ signature encodings as a practical example. Q&A addressed timelines: By end-2026, zkVM circuits/precompiles/EVM lowering/crypto specs; 2027 for compiler stack and consensus specs/implementations.

## Key Takeaways
- **Robust Tooling**: Develop methodologies for rapid, scalable verification to enable faster Ethereum upgrades, less auditing, and upstream simplifications from formal insights.
- **zkVM Track**: Verify constraints and witnesses for proof soundness; progress on RISC-V circuits in Lean, SMT integration in CI, and unifying via LCIR dialect.
- **EVM Track**: Ensure lowered bytecode matches formal EVM semantics across multiple zkEVMs and upcoming implementations.
- **Cryptography Track**: Validate proof system code against executable specs with formalized security; aim for quick verification of new IOPs pre-peer review.
- **Challenges**: Scale across DSLs/precompiles/compilers; handle EVM-client interactions and consensus bugs (e.g., recent critical subs bug).
- **Workshop Focus**: ArkLib for crypto specs/Rust; end-to-end for full L1 zkVMs (LeanVM/consensus/compilers); PQ encodings for broader application.
- **Timelines**: 2026 for core zkVM/EVM/crypto; 2027 for compilers/consensus, aligning with PQ integration goals.
