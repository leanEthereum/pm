## Summary
The Proximity Prize workshop, led by Giacomo Fenzi and Benedikt Wagner with various participants, focused on advancing the $1M incentive for breakthroughs in coding theory conjectures related to Ethereum's PQ security. The session emphasized two main activities: numerical experiments to test conjecture parameters in practical regimes and combinatorial arguments to analyze asymptotic behavior as parameters approach limits.

Discussions began with the need for efficient ways to find counterexamples that violate conjectures in high-distance regimes, involving combinatorics and programming. Participants explored metrics like eta (distance from capacity) and delta, aiming to derive lower bounds on error probabilities. The group split into teams: one for numerical simulations (testing codes, domains, and fields) and another for combinatorics (formalizing intuitions on folding, agreements, and coverings).

Key explorations included Johnson bounds, list-decoding, mutual vs. correlated agreements, and Groebner basis complexities. Numerical efforts involved optimizing searches for bad events (e.g., high-distance words close to codes), with suggestions for random sampling, subset interpolations, and FPGA/hardware acceleration. Combinatorial debates covered coverage radii, unique neighbor properties, and proofs for claims like "every w is close to a codeword" in random codes.

The workshop fostered collaborative problem-solving, with ideas for shared documents, simulations in tools like Magma, and potential refinements to conjectures based on results. No major breakthroughs were reported, but progress was made on intuition-building and experimental setups.

## Key Takeaways
- Focus on numerical experiments to test conjecture robustness in practical parameter regimes (e.g., code length n, dimension k, distance d), seeking efficient counterexample searches.
- Combinatorial arguments aim to bound error rates as eta (1 - rate - distance) approaches limits, formalizing behaviors like folding agreements and coverage radii.
- Explored mutual/correlated agreements, Johnson bounds, and Groebner basis for potential attacks; emphasized random codes and list-decoding.
- Group work: Numerical team on simulations (e.g., random words, deep holes); combinatorics on proofs (e.g., interpolation, unique neighbors).
- Suggestions for tools (Magma, hardware), shared docs, and refinements; no breaks but increased confidence in conjectures.
