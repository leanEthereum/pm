## Summary
Dmitry Khovratovich from the Ethereum Foundation's cryptography team provided updates on the Poseidon hash function, tracing its evolution and ongoing security efforts. He outlined the history starting from 2018, when an insecure hash in a STARK paper prompted development, leading to Poseidon's publication in 2019. Despite initial rejection in StarkWare's 2020 hash competition (later reversed), Poseidon has become a de-facto standard for ZK-friendly hashing, inspiring designs like Poseidon2 (2023) for small fields and efficient linear layers.

Poseidon operates as a permutation (512 or 768 bits) for short (compression mode: H(x) = P(x) + x) or long outputs (sponge mode), balancing algebraic structure for ZK efficiency with security. Khovratovich emphasized building confidence through attack papers, bounties on reduced versions, grants for algebraic attacks, and cryptanalytic workshops.

The Poseidon Initiative (2024-2026), led by Khovratovich, Antonio Sanso, and George Kadianakis with an advisory board, aims to evaluate its suitability for Ethereum components. In 2025, ~$358K was spent on bounties ($74K paid), grants ($223K for topics like clustering differentials and Groebner basis attacks), workshops ($25K for events in Rome, Spain, Luxembourg), and hardware ($36K for FPGA experiments). No major breaks occurred; new papers advanced theory but didn't reduce security margins.

For 2026, plans include protocol-specific bounties (e.g., Fiat-Shamir zero-tests, PQ signatures), grants on resultant attacks, Groebner bounds, and quantum sponges, additional workshops (Eurocrypt co-location, Asia/US events, final in Luxembourg), and a final evaluation report signed by experts to formalize confidence.

Q&A covered constants optimization (random vs. chosen for performance, no major risks if tests pass), Groebner basis complexity metrics suggesting overestimation of rounds, bounty ideas for zero-knowledge properties, and comparisons to Rescue/Marvellous (Poseidon's consistent degree growth resists "free-lunch" attacks better).

## Key Takeaways
- Poseidon has evolved from a 2018 fix for STARK insecurity to a widely cited ZK-friendly standard, with Poseidon2 optimizing for small fields.
- Security confidence builds via bounties (reduced versions unbroken at higher bits), grants (new algebraic analyses), workshops (20-30 attendees fostering collaboration), and no major cryptanalytic advances in 2025.
- Initiative's 2025 spending: Bounties yielded practical insights without breaks; grants filled research gaps; workshops advanced discussions.
- 2026 focus: Protocol-integrated bounties, quantum/Groebner grants, more workshops, and a signed expert report for Ethereum adoption decisions.
- Trade-offs: Algebraic structure aids ZK but requires scrutiny; constants can be optimized safely if passing invariance tests.
