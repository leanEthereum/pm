## Summary
Unnawut "O" Leepaisalsuwanna from the Ream lean client team provided updates on the post-quantum (PQ) devnet progress, emphasizing iterative development to prove PQ signature viability, multi-client interoperability, resource constraints (per EIP-7870), and spec gaps. Devnet-0 (in progress, no PQ sigs) focuses on bootstrapping with 3SF-mini consensus, new specs framework, basic infrastructure/metrics, and interop among Ream (Rust), Zeam (Zig), and Qlean (C++), starting with 10-100 validators. It validates foundational coordination as Ethereum's first "integration test" for lean consensus. Devnet-1 (soon, targeting Devconnect demo) introduces PQ sig generation/verification (using b-wagn/hash-sig) for blocks/attestations, aiming for sub-second timings and 24+ hour stability without aggregation. Philosophy: Many incomplete devnets enable parallel spec/implementation, tight feedback, and faster production-readiness. Workshop goals: Reflect on Devnet-0, unblock issues, plan Devnet-1+ (e.g., aggregation, P2P, rainbow staking), define metrics/targets. Big questions: Pace improvements, broader contributions to lean Ethereum. Outcomes: Demo Devnet-0, lessons learned, specs/direction for future devnets.

## Key Takeaways
- **Objectives**: Prove PQ multi-sig viability/sub-second ops; validate interop/resources/specs; build reusable infra/metrics/coordination for lean consensus.
- **Devnet-0 Progress**: Bootstrapping complete (specs, 3SF-mini consensus, metrics, interop); fixed validators (10-100); no PQ sigs; challenges like gossipsub params reconciled via state dumps (test vectors via PR #76 for Devnet-1).
- **Devnet-1 Goals**: PQ sig gen/sign/verify for blocks/attestations; full 4s pipeline; targets: block/attestation signing <1s (500μs), verification <1s (300μs); 24+ hour finalized chain.
- **Timeline**: June (Beam Day/EthCC start); July (first interop, views/specs); Aug-Sep (specs/impls); Oct (infra/completion); Nov (Devnet-1 done); future: Devnet-2+ for aggregation/P2P/rainbow staking.
- **Client Teams**: Ream (Rust), Zeam (Zig), Qlean (C++ + P2P), Lantern (C), Colibri (light client), LambdaClass (crypto), Prysm (Go Beacon).
- **Workshop Focus**: Review Devnet-0, plan Devnet-1+ specs (e.g., sig containers/types, test vectors, infra); demo Devnet-0; discuss big questions like velocity/contributions.
- **Q&A**: Devnet-1 uses single sigs (aggregation in Devnet-2 if ready); 24-hour stability metric for success.
