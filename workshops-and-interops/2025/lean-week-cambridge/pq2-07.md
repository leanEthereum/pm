## Summary
Ulrich Haböck presented a note on correlated agreement, vectorizing it as the Correlated Agreement Theorem (CAT) for pairs (u0, u1) over domain D: if random linear combinations uz = u0 + z·u1 are close to code C (with notable probability for few z), then (u0, u1) is close to C^2. He clarified that stated CA lacks relation between agreement sets Az (for uz) and A (for (u0, u1)), but proofs reveal collinearity of proximates (COP): a fraction of proximates pz lie on a line q0 + z·q1. COP implies CA via a "standard" argument bounding |S| > n implying A equals some Az. COP is a local version of mutual correlated agreement (mCA), essential in proofs. Practical uses in Ligero (up to 2/3·δ0), DEEP-FRI (1-3∛(1-δ0)), and WHIR. The standard argument uses unique z per disagreement point to bound sizes. Q&A explored proofs for unique/list decoding and refinements.

## Key Takeaways
- CAT vectorizes CA: Linear combinations close to C imply pair closeness to C^2; COP (collinearity) stronger, implies CA via standard argument.
- Standard argument: If |S| > n and |D \ A| bounds, A equals some Az; unique z per disagreement enforces bounds.
- COP localizes mCA; crucial for constrained/weighted/set-specific CATs in protocols like Basefold, FRI-Binius, WHIR.
- Implicit in proofs from Ligero (2/3·δ0) to mCAT for RS codes (1-√(1-δ0)); enables secure LDR.
- Open: Relaxations for better epsilons; equivalences between CA/mCA; hardware/practice for directions/variations.
