## Summary
Albert Garreta, in collaboration with Ignacio Manzur, presented on the ethSTARK toy problem, a simplified framework for analyzing the security of STARK protocols using FRI (Fast Reed-Solomon Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity) to test low-degree proximity. The session outlined two key ethSTARK conjectures: the first bounding the toy problem's soundness error to ≤1/|𝔽| + ρ^nq (where ρ = (d+1)/|D|), and the second asserting that the full STARK IOP is as hard as the toy problem. Garreta introduced new results, including an orthogonal attack on the toy problem achieving success probability >1/|𝔽| + ρ^nq + (2ρ)^nq / |𝔽|, and a simple attack on the STARK IOP with probability (d+1)/|𝔽|. A third result demonstrates that for any strategy on a toy problem variation, there exists a STARK IOP strategy with success probability (d+1)/|𝔽| + Pr[toy]. The talk explored attacks involving dishonest polynomials, folding operations, and isolated variables in AIR (Algebraic Intermediate Representation) instances, showing the STARK IOP is strictly harder than the toy variation. It concluded with open questions on toy settings, variation hardness, and intermediate FRI rounds, sparking discussion on refining conjectures for Ethereum's PQ security.

## Key Takeaways
- The presented attacks disprove the simultaneous truth of both ethSTARK conjectures, with the toy problem attack offering a new orthogonal method potentially combinable with others.
- The STARK IOP is strictly harder than a natural variation of the toy problem, particularly when AIR has isolated variables, enabling false proofs of evaluations.
- General assumptions about FRI's query phase adding only ρ^nq error are incorrect; the actual term is at least ρ^nq + (2ρ)^nq / |𝔽|.
- The toy problem serves as a partial proxy for STARK IOP security but not a complete one, warranting careful selection of toy settings for analysis.
- Open challenges include assessing the hardness equivalence between the original toy problem and its variation, and exploring attacks on intermediate FRI folding rounds.
