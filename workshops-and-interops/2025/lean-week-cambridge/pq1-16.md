## Summary
In a debrief led by Justin Drake, participants recapped Day 1 sessions: Devnet progress (roadmap for Devnet-1 networking/sigs, Devnet-2 agg; adopt erasure-coded broadcast), P2P stack (from libp2p to minp2p/QUIC/TLS; object-specific protocols), Proximity Prize (rules/anti-spam/outreach), and FFT/computation (base-field FFTs, ring-switching, cache-oblivious, Plenta arithmetic). Collaborative learnings emphasized optimizations and cross-pollination. Closing: Dinner at Porter's Lodge.

## Key Takeaways
- **Devnet/Roadmap**: Complete Devnet-0 interop; Devnet-1 (networking/PQ sigs, erasure-coded broadcast); defer recursion to Devnet-2; geod/lessons for Devnet-1+.
- **P2P Stack**: Align with EF L1; adopt minp2p (QUIC/TLS primary); object-specific broadcasts (blocks/attestations/aggs); prototype geod/agg (e.g., QUIC + erasure-coding).
- **Proximity Prize**: Submission limits/ranking; anti-spam (flawed approaches registry); outreach (AMS/workshops/journals); iterative drafts for rules/judging.
- **FFT/Computation**: Base-field early rounds; ring-switching/extension effects; cache-oblivious/square-root FFTs; Plenta ~20% faster multiplications; generic APIs for trees/fields.
- **Meta**: Expert collaboration highlights optimization potential; FFT internals new to many; document effects for Devnets.
- **Open Questions**: Recursive agg readiness (Devnet-2?); validator membership proofs; network sizes/bandwidth; complete criteria; aggregation timing.
