## Summary
Quang Dao presented a walkthrough of ArkLib, a Lean library for formally verified SNARK protocols, part of the zkEVM project. He demonstrated Lean code for coding theory (e.g., Reed-Solomon codes, proximity gaps, Johnson bound proofs), emphasizing mechanized security proofs and executable specs. Discussions covered Lean features like type checking, error messages, and tactics (e.g., simp, linear_arith). He formalized Interactive Oracle Reductions (IORs) for modularity, with examples like Sum-Check as compositions. Virtualization for protocols like Spartan invoking Sum-Check was explained. Protocols in progress: Sum-Check, (Super)Spartan, FRI/BaseFold/FRI-Binius, STIR/WHIR, Fiat-Shamir. Prelims include computable polynomials, binary tower fields, coding theory. Infrastructure: VCVio for crypto, iris-lean for program logic. Q&A explored Lean challenges (e.g., notation, automation, constructiveness), proof strategies, and future Rust extractions.

## Key Takeaways
- ArkLib provides executable SNARK specs and mechanized proofs; addresses scattered/informal literature and lack of spec-implementation linkage.
- Formalized IORs enable compositions; virtualization handles nested protocols like Spartan+Sum-Check.
- Requires computable polynomials, binary fields, coding theory (proximity gaps/Johnson bound proven).
- Lean proofs: Johnson bound mechanized; tactics/automation reduce effort; errors guide corrections.
- Contributors needed; future: BCS+Fiat-Shamir, Rust extractions; emphasizes modularity for manageable proofs.
