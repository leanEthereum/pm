## Summary
The Day 3 kickoff welcomed attendees, noting fatigue and plans for a group photo, college visit (Jesus College chapel/story), and drinks. Team leads outlined agendas: Unnawut "O" (devnet) on client interop (Reth, Zeam, Lantern finalizing); Benedikt Wagner (theory) on signatures, Lean P2P; formal verification open for discussions; Thomas Coratger (implementation) on zkEVM recursion (Plonky3 vs Cairo) and optimizations. Proximity Prize session open for ideas; $600k budget noted, seeking acceleration strategies. Q&A covered simulations, security parameters.

## Key Takeaways
- Devnet: Finalize interop for demo; focus on 50-50 parameters.
- Theory: Signatures, Lean P2P; encodings/security discussions.
- Formal Verification: Open; revisit Day 1 issues.
- Implementation: zkEVM recursion comparisons; Plonky3 optimizations.
- Proximity Prize: Brainstorm spending $600k+; increase ideas.
