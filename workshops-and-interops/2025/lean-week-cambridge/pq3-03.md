## Summary
Clément Walter presented the Cairo M design document, a minimal zkVM inspired by Cairo for efficient proving of small-field arithmetic. Discussions covered design principles (efficiency via few constraints/recursion, auditability with modular code/reusable libs, usefulness through expressive ISA). Memory model: range-checked segment, 31-bit words (KoalaBear field), read/write ops with lookups for consistency, clock updates for ordering. Opcodes: minimal set (e.g., ADD/MUL, JUMP) + extensions (uint types, built-ins like hashes). Q&A explored comparisons to leanVM (multilinear vs univariate STARKs), recursion, memory costs (~8-10x EVM gas), formalization.

## Key Takeaways
- Efficiency: Small constraints/recursion for STARK-friendliness; memory lookups/clock cost ~8-10x EVM gas.
- Auditability: Modular codebase; generic soundness proofs; avoids large compilers.
- Usefulness: Read/write memory, uint extensions, subroutine/branching opcodes.
- Memory: Range-checked segment; lookups ensure consistency; navigators for values.
- Opcodes: AIR basics; minimal ISA + built-ins; extensions for uint (e.g., 256-bit).
