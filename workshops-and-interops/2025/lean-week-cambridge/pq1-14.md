## Summary
Unnawut "O" Leepaisalsuwanna led a planning session for PQ Devnet 1, focusing on agendas (fixed: metrics/keynotes; flexible: P2P/interop/specs), objectives (complete Devnet-0 demo, lessons for Devnet-1, define PQ sig specs), Devnet-0 retrospective (pain points/successes, multi-client interop push), Devnet-1 scope (PQ sigs without recursion; single vs. role-specific types), P2P topology (structured vs. GossipSub; anonymous membership proofs), testing (JSON vectors, serialization, devnets repo), and coordination (configs/goals/status tracking). Decisions include interop runs (Zeam/Rust/C++), P2P breakout, JSON tests, devnets repo refresh, Devnet-1 specs pre-Devconnect. Open questions: Single/role-specific sigs, anonymous proofs, network sizes/bandwidth, Devnet-0 complete criteria, aggregation scope, serialization details.

## Key Takeaways
- **Agendas/Objectives**: Fixed sessions (metrics/keynotes); flexible breakouts; complete Devnet-0, lessons learned, Devnet-1 specs (PQ sigs: single/role-specific?).
- **Devnet-0 Retrospective**: Pain points (e.g., interop blockers); successes (specs/impls); push multi-client (Zeam/Rust/C++).
- **Devnet-1 Scope**: PQ sig gen/verify (no recursion/agg initially); BLAST integration; tier by complexity (Devnet-2+ for advanced).
- **P2P Topology**: Structured (e.g., Brayda Chainweb) vs. GossipSub; anonymous validator proofs for authentication/Sybil resistance; incentivized/rotating roles.
- **Testing/Specs**: JSON vectors (avoid YAML); explicit endianness/state-root checks; shared devnets repo for configs/goals/dashboard.
- **Coordination**: Weekly status; avoid crypto overlap; park aggregation/recursion for later.
- **Open Questions**: Sig types, anonymous proofs, network sizes/bandwidth, complete criteria, aggregation timing, serialization (endianness/canonicalization).
