## Summary
The Day 2 recap covered parallel tracks: Devnet advanced client interop (Reth, Zeam, Lantern) and bindings (Rust challenges, solutions like objcopy, linker scripts); Formal Verification explored encodings, n12 stack, ArkLib walkthrough; Networking modeled 16k nodes/validators, 32 global/256 local aggregators, 64 subnets, UDP chunking for 512KB aggregates (IPv6 MTU 1280 bytes, ~432 chunks), authentication, anonymity; Implementation reviewed leanVM whitepaper (architecture, opcodes, proving) and memory arguments via tree-based compilation. Action items: PQ drop demo, bindings prototypes, erasure coding adaptations.

## Key Takeaways
- Devnet: Progress on client communication; bindings focus on Rust compatibility via precompiled libs/objcopy.
- Formal Verification: Agent-assisted proofs; discussions on compilers, languages for zkEVM stack.
- Networking: Parameters for scalability; UDP/MTU optimization; commitments for aggregate reuse; anonymity via mixnets.
- Implementation: leanVM opcodes/memory models; generic VM architectures for efficient local verifications.
- Overall: Collaborative breakthroughs; continue interop, modeling for realistic PQ integration.
